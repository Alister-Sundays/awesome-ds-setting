Hello üëã 

After setting/reinstalling a couple of machines from scratch in the last few weeks,  I decided for once and for all to document my default data science setting and environment.

I am working with macOS Montarey but most of this tools in this document are OS agnostic (e.g., Windows, Linux, etc.).

üí° **A pro tip** üëâüèº avoid dropping a cup of ‚òïÔ∏è on your machine ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

### Setting Git and SSH

Initial setting for Git

Source: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup


**Note:** you may have to install `command line developer tools`, if it is not already installed on your machine, it will pop-up the following option, and you will have to install it:

#### Set users

``` shell
git config --global user.name "John Doe"
git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
```

#### Set default branch name

The `init.defaultBranch` argument set the default branch name when running `git init`:

``` shell
git config --global init.defaultBranch main
```

#### Set SSH

Setting `SSH` key required to sync your local git repositories with the `origin`. To set SSH key on your local machine you need to use `ssh-keyget`:

``` shell
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "YOUR_EAMIL@example.com"
```

Note that `-t` argument enable you to define the type of algorithm for authentication key, in this case I used `ed25519` and the `-C` argument used to add comment,in this case the user name email.

You will have to enter the file name for the SSH key, by default it will save it under the `~/.ssh` folder. 

**Note:** this process will generate two files:
- `your_ssh_key` is the private key, you should not expose it
- `your_ssh_key.pub` is the public key which will be used to to set the SSH on Github

The next step is to register the key on your Github account. Under setting select on the main menu `SSH and GPG keys` and click on the `New SSH key`:

And then, set the key name and paste the public key inside the key box:

Next step is to update the `config` file on the `~/.ssh` folder. You can edit the `config` file with `vim`:

``` shell
vim ~/.ssh/config 
```

and add somewhere on the file the following code:

``` shell
Host *
  AddKeysToAgent yes
  UseKeychain yes
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/your_ssh_key
```
Where `your_ssh_key` is the private key file name


Last, run the following to load the key:
```
ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/your_ssh_key
```

### Install R and RStudio

**Note:** Older releases available on [CRAN Archive](https://cran-archive.r-project.org/bin/macosx/).

Once R installed, you can install RStudio - go to https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/ and select the version and download it:
